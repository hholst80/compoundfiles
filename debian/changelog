compoundfiles (0.3-1~ppa1) precise; urgency=medium

  * Added a comprehensive test suite and fixed several small bugs as a result
    (all to do with invalid file handling) (#2)
  * Added an mmap emulation to enable reading of massive files on 32-bit
    systems; the emulation is necessarily slower than "proper" mmap but that's
    the cost of staying on 32-bit! (#6)
  * Extended the warning and error hierarchy so that users of the library can
    fine tune exactly what warnings they want to consider errors (#3)

compoundfiles (0.2-1~ppa1) precise; urgency=low

  * Fixed a nasty bug where opening multiple streams in a compound document

  * Fixed Python 3 compatibility - many thanks to Martin Panter for the bug
    report! (#5)
